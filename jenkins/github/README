To set these up setup a top level pipeline first with:
 - github project url set
 - string paramter of SHA1
 - github pull requests build trigger - Hooks with persisted data
	- cancel queued
	- abort running
	- trigger on:
		- comment pattern ".*\[approve\W+ci(.*)\]"
		- pull request opened
		- commit changed
		- not merged - skip

Each Individual build pipeline needs to have parameters of:
	- SHA1
	- GITHUB_URL

and clang-analyzer also needs:
	- GITHUB_PR_NUMBER
